# acorn.css
A minimal (opinionated) classless CSS framework.

- [Demo](https://jomurgel.github.io/acorn.css/)

## Contents
I've attempted to include base styles for all major HTML5 elements  with 100% [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) compliance.

This framework uses no classes, though does lean a bit on data attributes which is typically easier to work with especially when working with JavaScript also. My preference, you don't need to like it.

This framework supports native dark/light mode out of the box, but nothing has been built to toggle between the two.

The demo includes everything you might need for content elements, images and media, form, interactive, and table elements.

Additional information found at the [https://jomurgel.github.io/acorn.css/#info](bottom), some FYIs, some gotchas.

More to come.
